Our first target is android.  So you'll probably need an android phone, maybe a second one (or at least a friend), though it will is possible several apps in *local* mode.

Let's face it we are not providing a magic "export to android" button to pd, but we're trying to get close to it, you'll still need to get your hands a little dirty and that means amongst other things :

* installing eclipse.
* installing android SDK
* installing the android developper tool plugin for eclipse.

#Installing eclipse

This should be easy enough. Just go [here](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) and download the **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers** package for your system. Run the installer, and you are cleared for this step.

#Installing android SDK

This is pretty simple too. Go [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html), and download **Stand-alone sdk tools**. 

You will also have to add SDK packages, but you just have to follow the steps described [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html).

#Installing ADT plugin for eclipse

This is trickiest step, but it often quite straight forward, you just have to follow the instructions described [here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html).

You are now good to go !
