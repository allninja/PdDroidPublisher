We have build a few demo applications that use and illustrate the features we have developped :

* jamming over wifi.
* full support of the pd gui.
* muti-view support.
* saving system.
* gui cutomization.

Those applications are still **alpha** versions, that means they need testing and everything may not work exactly as expected.

We need your help to get feedback, so don't hesitate to write constructive comments, and help us improve our system, via the commenting system on android, via the [issue tracker on github]({{ site.github_new_issue }}), or via e-mail at [{{ site.email}}](mailto:{{ site.email}}).

All those applications are available for free on the android market, the Pure-Data patches are available on github.
