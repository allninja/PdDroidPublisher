      <h1>PPP</h1>
      <h1>What is it about ?</h1>
      <p>PPP stands for PdPartyPublisher and it's a project that will help you to export your own Pure-Data patches thanks to libpd to a full fledged application, that you can distribute as you want - in respect of the license agreement. It's not all but that is what you can do at minima, at most you can build custom guis and benefit from a standard midi clock shared over wifi for all your patches (that's last one is the "party" part !)</p>
      <p>PPP is based on <a href="http://droidparty.net/">PdDroidParty</a> by Chris McCormick, itself based on  <a href="https://github.com/libpd">Libpd</a> by Peter Brinkman, itself based on <a href="http://puredata.info/">Pure-Data</a> by Miller Puckette.</p>
      <p> Our goal was not replace anything, but to make it possible for you to integrate new stuff into your workflow and let also non-pders to benefit from your voodoo pd skills in their standard midi setup.</p>
      <p>You can check out the very first batch of applications (still alpha) at this <a href="{{post_url 2015-10-05-samples}}">page</a> <p>
      <p> So from now either you are : </p>
      <li> an app user : and you can check the documentation here to start jamming. </li>
      <li> a pd developper : and you can check the documentation here to start building an application from a Pure-Data patch. </li>
      <li> a software developper : and you can check the documentation on the repo's <a href="https://github.com/b2renger/PdDroidPublisher/wiki">wiki</a> to start contributing. </li>
