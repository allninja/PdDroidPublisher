      <h1>PPP</h1>
      <p>To sum up, PPP is a framework offering to support midi jamming over wifi features to audio applications and instruments. That means that apps can be connected to each other over wifi with a slave/master paradigm, enabling each sequencer to be in synch with each others.</p>
      <h1>What is it about ?</h1>
      <p>PPP stands for <b>P</b>uredata <b>P</b>arty <b>P</b>ublisher and it's a project that will help you to export your own Pure-Data patches thanks to libpd to a full fledged application, that you can distribute as you want - in respect of the license agreement. It's not all but that is what you can do at minima, at most you can build custom guis and benefit from a standard midi clock shared over wifi for all your patches (that's last one is the "party" part !)</p>
      <p> Our goal was not replace anything, but to make it possible for you to integrate new stuff into your workflow and let also non-pders to benefit from your voodoo pd skills in their standard midi setup.</p>
      <p> If we can start an audio developpers community to build a wide range of musical apps sharing their beats over wifi : all the better ! </p>
      <p>You can check out the very <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ppp-samples">first batch of applications</a> (still alpha).

      <p> So from now either you are : </p>
      <li> a <b>performer</b> : So you can checkout <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/user-guide">the user guide</a> to start jamming. </li>
      <li> a <b>pd designer</b> : So you can checkout <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/dev-guide">the programmer guide</a> to start building an application from a Pure-Data patch. </li>
      <li> a <b>PPP Contributor</b> : So you can checkout <a href="{{site.github_wiki}}">the project wiki</a> to start contributing. </li>
